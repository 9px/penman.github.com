Hi! I'm Ross Penman. I'm a 15-year-old developer from Scotland.

I was recently nominated for the Emerging Talent of the Year Net Award. I'd really appreciate it if you [voted for me](https://thenetawards.com/vote/talent/ross-penman/).

I care a lot about computing education. I wrote [this](/computing-education) about it.
